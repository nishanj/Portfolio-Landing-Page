    <h2>about My Portfolio</h2>
    <h4>Education Background</h4>
    <h4>Job Experience</h4>
    <p>As a Graduate, I had a passion of taking a course in programming to enhance my career path, I have been part timing with different companies ranging from Tech, Agric and SME’s. However, is from these companies that influenced me to take a course in programming and my idols like founder of Microsoft (Bill Gate), founder of Alibaba.com and Founder of Facebook(Mark Zarburg) all these were my aspirant to me</p>
    <p>In fact, what I want to express formally here is how wonderful programming is! The only regret I have is not taking it much earlier (if only I had done such a course a ago!!). And indeed now I enjoy at it’s pre-stage of programming</p>
    <p>n addition, a lot of the stuff here can be applied back in business context throughout East Africa. Not everything but quite a fair bit in general. In nut-shell, upon completion of the programming(Prep Programming) I would like to develop and design approach of changing my community through technology so that access to market, information and services are easily availed near them.</p>
